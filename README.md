# Prediction_Project_CNN-TrasnferLearning-Autoencoder
This innovative project aims to revolutionize early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the medical field by harnessing advanced medical data. Our approach centers around the analysis of medical MRI images in NIfTI format sourced from the prestigious ADNI database. The primary objective is to develop Deep Learning models, including CNNs, Transfer Learning, and Autoencoders, to make predictions on these MRI images. Through this approach, we aspire to make a significant contribution to early Alzheimer's disease detection, This will help make diagnostics more accurate and timely.
